# Windows Gadget Booru Clock
A desktop clock with the booru's girls holding digits.

Has only classic static booru's girls.

Original written by Studio M (www.studiom.at). I improved it a bit and
added settings to hide the seconds and change the clock size.

# Installation

On the [Releases page](https://github.com/7nik/booru-clock/releases) download
the `Booru.Clock.gadget` file and double-click it.

Then use the desktop's context menu to add the gadget to the desktop.

### Ability to install Windows Gadgets on a recent version of Windows

Their support was removed for a reason, but if you really want it, install
[8GadgetPack](https://8gadgetpack.net/) or [Gadgets Revived Sidebar](https://windows10gadgets.pro/sidebarforwindows10/gadgets-revieved-sidebar-for-windows.html).
